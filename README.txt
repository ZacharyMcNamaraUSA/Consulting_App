ConsultingApp provides an efficient GUI for users to interact with up-to-date company data stored in its database.

Program is built using
    IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.1 (Ultimate Edition)
    JDK-11.0.8-x64
    JavaFX-SDK-11.0.2

To run this program, most functionality is simplistic by nature, but there are a few special notes to be aware of:
    To Delete a record from the database the user must be on the 'Edit' screen/Scene. This includes, Appointment, Customer, among others.
    There are four (4) different reports for this Program...
        the Appointment by Type Report and Appointment by Month Report have been separated for readability. 
    
    A script for initial database population has been provided for the user, src/Database/database-repopulation-script.txt...
        However, additional datum has been added to the database for increased development testing. The user may override or delete any and all data.
